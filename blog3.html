            <h3>5 stars review on Apple podcast 💬</h3>
            <p>"I started listening to 99% Invisible because of Conan O'Brien. I'd always wanted to read The Power Broker and this podcast gave me the reason and motivation to start. It had been sitting on my shelf for years after all. After re-listening to episode one and hearing Robert Caro thank Roman and Elliot, it got me choked up. Listening to the sincerity of Caro's gratitude for what they were doing just filled my heart. Thank you so much for doing this. It means so much to me too.”</p>

            <p>Topic🔖: Technology Trends</p>
            <h3>5 stars review on Apple podcast 💬</h3>
            <p>"Truly one of the most entertaining podcasts, whether or not you’re a tech nerd. The banter is fun, the opposing views add depth and keep things from being one-sided. App reviews have been incredibly helpful in discovering new tools I need but didn’t find on my own or was too overwhelmed to search for. Bonus points for the best podcast theme of all time. Thanks Casey and Kevin!  PS For those who celebrate, Casey Newton does not sound bald.”</p>

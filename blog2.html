        <h1>Becoming a UX Designer vs. UX Researcher</h1>
        <p>Choosing between UX Design and UX Research can shape your career in exciting ways. Below, we’ll explore the key differences and offer resources to help you decide.</p>

        <h2>UX Researcher</h2>
        <p>
            Before a UX designer can begin the design stage of a project, they must understand who they are designing for. 
            Who is the target market? What motivates them? How will the product improve their lives? Without these insights, 
            it’s impossible to design a good product. Finding the answers to these questions is the role of a UX researcher.
        </p>
        <p>
            A UX researcher analyzes consumer behavior and forms data-driven insights to address the needs of the consumers. 
            Once they have these insights, they turn them over to the larger UX design team so they can create products that 
            meet the needs of their audience.
        </p>

        <h3>What are the most common UX researcher skill sets?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Data analysis and analytical thinking</li>
            <li>Problem-solving</li>
            <li>Deep understanding of users and their needs</li>
            <li>Strong communication skills</li>
            <li>Working with online UX research tools like UXtweak</li>
            <li>Research design skills</li>
            <li>Research planning and strategy</li>
            <li>Knowledge and implementation of UX research methods</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>UX Designer</h2>
        <p>
            A UX designer’s job is to design a user-friendly product that addresses the needs of the consumer. 
            Only after a UX designer has a firm grasp on the target market can they begin the design process. 
            The UX designer gains this awareness from the UX researcher’s findings.
        </p>
        <p>
            UX Designers are sometimes also called Product Designers, but there’s a slight difference between the two roles. 
            UX designers are more involved when it comes to solving issues found on a website. While UX researchers do the actual research, 
            UX designers communicate with visual designers and creative directors, so they can incorporate findings into the website or 
            digital product to provide the right experience for users.
        </p>

        <h3>Why do you need them both when adjusting your UX?</h3>
        <p>
            You need both a UX designer and a UX researcher when working to improve UX. One cannot function without the other. 
            These two positions are like the Yin-Yang of user experience. They complement each other and they could not function 
            without themselves. Like Thanos said, "perfectly balanced, as all things should be."
